            <br></br><h3>Direct and Indirect Sunlight</h3>
            <p>There are two types of sunlight – Direct and Indirect sunlight, the tricky part is arranging your houseplants to those specific areas of your home.

            <br></br><h1>Direct Sunlight</h1>
            <p>This refers to sunlight where the ray of light from the sun directly lands on your plant without any obstruction. This may be your windowsills or under a skylight, as mentioned before a grow light can be substituted for direct sunlight.</p>
            
            <br></br><h1>Indirect Sunlight</h1>
            <p>This refers to sunlight where the ray of light from the sun is diffused or filters the sunlight before it hits your plant. This may be a tree outside your window, curtains, or furniture. You can also use another house plant to create indirect light. If your house plant is far away from a window for example if it is in the back corner of a room, this is considered indirect sunlight.</p>
            
            <br></br><h3>Amount of Light – Low Medium High Light</h3>
            <p>Each plant has a different degree of light they need to <b><i>THRIVE</i></b>. The “easy” plants have multiple different levels of light they can have to be healthy.</p>
            
            <br></br><h1>Low Light</h1>

            <br></br><h1>Medium Light (indirect and partial sunlight)</h1>
            <p>As the title says, these require medium amounts of light. These plants can be okay in direct sunlight, but they tend to prefer indirect light. The two types medium sunlight are Indirect and Partial Sunlight.</p>
            <p><b>Indirect Sunlight –</b> the plant is in a shady area within an area that receives a lot of sunlight. It may be behind another plant or filtered from a tree outside or curtains.</p>
            <p><b>Partial Sunlight –</b> the plant gets direct sunlight during a part of the day, for example only in the morning or late afternoon. It is common to place these plants near an east-facing windows so that they receive a couple hours of direct morning sunlight.</p>
            
            <br></br><h1>High Light</h1>
            <p>These plants require quite a bit of light, Direct or Indirect sun exposure during the day(around 5-6+ hours). Most of these plants can withstand a lot of direct sunlight but make sure they do not get sunburn.</p>
